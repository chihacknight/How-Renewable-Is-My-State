        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This site was built by the How Renewable Is My State breakout group at <a href='https://chihacknight.org/'>Chi Hack Night</a>. To see the names of the contributors who built it, see <a href='#Team'>below</a>. To see how this site was built, check out the <a href='https://github.com/chihacknight/How-Renewable-Is-My-State'>Github Repo</a>.</p>
        <p>This visualization uses energy consumption data from the <a href='https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/'>State Energy Data System (SEDS)</a> pages of the <a href='https://www.eia.gov/'>US Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA)</a> website. All of
            the energy values contained in this visualization represent energy consumed in billions of BTU. A more detailed overview of how we arrived at these values is outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>All of the energy consumption categories contained in this visualization rely on the definitions used by the EIA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total Energy Consumption</li>
            <li>Fossil Fuels - fossil fuels total consumption</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Coal - coal total consumption</li>
                <li>Natural Gas - natural gas total consumption (excluding supplemental gaseous fuels)</li>
                <li>Petroleum - all petroleum products total consumption excluding fuel ethanol</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Nuclear - nuclear energy consumed for electricity generation, total</li>
            <li>Renewable Energy - renewable energy total consumption</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Fuel Ethanol - fuel ethanol, excluding denaturant, total consumption</li>
                <li>Geothermal - geothermal energy, total consumed</li>
                <li>Hydropower - hydropower, total consumed</li>
                <li>Solar - photovoltaic and solar thermal energy, total consumed</li>
                <li>Wood and Waste - wood and waste total consumed</li>
                <li>Wind - wind energy, total consumed</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Interstate Imports/Exports - net interstate flow of electricity and associated losses (negative and positive values).</li>
        </ul>
